# Presentation Contract

**Date**: 2026-09-08 | **Spec**: 007-chat-reference-presentation

The default presentation of the shared chat component. Behavior, data, and customization channels are owned by specs 001-006; this contract records only the reference presentation and the tokens that drive it.

## Theme token additions

`ChatTheme` gains a `layout` group and additional tokens in the existing groups (full defaults in [data-model.md](../data-model.md)):

```ts
export interface ChatTheme {
  colors: {
    // existing tokens...
    userBubbleText: string // user bubble text color
    sendBackground: string // Send/Stop/scroll-to-latest control surface
    sendForeground: string // arrow/square glyph color on sendBackground
  }
  layout: {
    readingColumnWidth: number // 540
    composerWidth: number // 650
    sidePadding: number // 16
  }
  spacing: {
    // existing tokens...
    paragraphGap: number // 8
    composerBottomGap: number // 16
  }
  typography: {
    // existing tokens...
    messageLineHeight: number
    messageWeight: string
    composerLineHeight: number
    controlLineHeight: number
    controlWeight: string
    captionLineHeight: number
    captionWeight: string
    headingWeight: string
  }
}
```

`ThemeInput = DeepPartial<ChatTheme>` and `resolveTheme` merge the new groups exactly like the existing ones; an override that omits a new token falls back to the base theme.

## Reading column

The list spans the full panel so its scrollbar sits at the panel edge; each message row centers its content in a reading column 540 px wide at the reference panel (within FR-002's 10% and 8 px centering tolerances), with user bubbles ending at its right edge and assistant text starting at its left edge. Narrower panels shrink the column to the panel width minus `sidePadding` on each side. No drawer gutter is reserved.

## Composer

A centered pill at the bottom of the chat area, `composerWidth` wide at the reference panel (wider than the reading column), white surface, thin neutral outline, subtle shadow, rounded corners (`composerRadius`), with `composerBottomGap` of clearance below it. The pill's row is vertically centered, so the single-line input text, Send, and its arrow share one center line; the pill grows upward to the configured limit and then scrolls internally, and an empty draft resets it to the single-line height. The composer input intentionally has no focus indicator in any theme, including high contrast. The right end holds the circular up-arrow Send (accessible name "Send") or, when cancellation is available, a same-area Stop with a square glyph. No plus or microphone control and no reserved space for one.

## Return-to-latest

The scroll-to-latest control (dark-grey `sendBackground` pill with a down-arrow glyph) and the unread badge render horizontally centered above the composer, never covering its input or controls.

## Role presentation

- User: right-aligned, content-sized, light-gray rounded bubble with no tail and dark readable text.
- Assistant: left-aligned text directly on the canvas, no bubble, card, border, avatar, or repeated role heading.
- System: existing stretch treatment, distinguishable from the conversation.

## Typography

Body text is the platform sans-serif at `messageTextSize`/`messageLineHeight`/`messageWeight`, with paragraph bottom margins of `paragraphGap` and turn gaps larger than line gaps. Markdown headings scale from `messageTextSize` at `headingWeight`; `strong`, `em`, links, and inline code are visually distinct. All values come from theme tokens (FR-014); the component never hardcodes a size, weight, or line height.

## Message actions

Available actions render as a compact, left-aligned row beneath assistant content, one `Pressable` per action labeled with its text, reachable by keyboard and touch without hover. Availability, grouping, and host customization are unchanged; no empty row renders when no action is available.

## Responsive and theme behavior

The same hierarchy holds on narrow and wide panels, in dark and high-contrast themes, at 200% zoom, and with enlarged text: surfaces reflow without panel-wide horizontal overflow, alignment stays distinct, and readable colors and visible focus on controls other than the composer input follow the theme. Host theme overrides, renderers, controls, icons, labels, actions, and states take precedence over these defaults.

## Stable identifiers

| Surface             | testID                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Reading column      | `chat.reading-column` (once per message row) |
| Composer pill       | `chat.composer.pill`                         |
| Message actions row | `chat.message-actions`                       |
| Per-action button   | `chat.action.<id>`                           |

All spec 001-006 testIDs are unchanged. `chat.action-menu` no longer appears in the default presentation.

## Behavioral guarantees (unchanged from specs 001-006)

- Message ordering, identity, scrolling, Markdown, draft, keyboard, composition, and cancellation behave as before (FR-010).
- No new drawer, header, account, model, attachment, voice, share, or branding control is introduced (FR-013).
- Accessibility, touch targets, focus, reduced motion, and high contrast are preserved, except that the composer input has no focus indicator by the temporary product exception in spec.md Clarifications.
