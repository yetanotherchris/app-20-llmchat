# Feature Specification: Shared Chat Component - Themes and Customization

**Feature Branch**: `004-shared-chat-themes-customization`

**Created**: 2026-09-07

**Status**: Archived

**Input**: User description: "Themes and customization for the shared chat component: light and dark themes, custom themes, and replaceable renderers, controls, states, and actions so the host application can shape the component to its own design."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Switch between light and dark (Priority: P1)

The user chooses the appearance, or the app matches the system setting, without any loss of readability.

**Why this priority**: A personal chat app is used at all hours; a fixed appearance is unacceptable.

**Independent Test**: Render the component in light and dark themes; confirm every surface follows the theme.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the component is in light theme, **When** the theme switches to dark, **Then** all surfaces update consistently.
2. **Given** a custom theme is applied, **When** it overrides a semantic token, **Then** every surface using that token reflects the override.
3. **Given** a theme switch happens while a response is streaming, **When** the theme flips, **Then** the stream continues and scroll position is preserved.

### User Story 2 - Replace renderers, controls, and actions (Priority: P2)

The host application replaces renderers and controls and adds its own actions and composer controls without modifying the component.

**Why this priority**: The component ships standalone; hosts need to match their own design system.

**Independent Test**: Provide custom renderers, controls, actions, and icons; confirm each is used in place of the default.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom message renderer is provided, **When** a message is displayed, **Then** the custom renderer is used.
2. **Given** a custom renderer for one content type is provided, **When** that content is displayed, **Then** the custom renderer is used and defaults apply elsewhere.
3. **Given** a custom renderer for one Markdown element (such as links) is provided, **When** a response renders, **Then** the custom renderer is used for that element and defaults apply elsewhere.
4. **Given** custom Send, Stop, and scroll-to-latest controls are provided, **When** the composer and list render, **Then** the custom controls are used.
5. **Given** the host registers message actions with grouping, **When** the action menu opens, **Then** each action appears in its group and fires with its message as context.
6. **Given** the host adds a composer control, **When** the composer renders, **Then** the added control appears and functions.
7. **Given** custom icons are supplied, **When** the composer and list render, **Then** no default icon appears.
8. **Given** no custom renderer is provided for a content type, **When** that content is displayed, **Then** the default renderer is used.

### User Story 3 - Replace status states (Priority: P3)

The empty, loading, typing, and error states are replaceable.

**Why this priority**: Hosts want their own empty and error experiences.

**Independent Test**: Provide custom state views and confirm they appear in the right conditions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a conversation with no messages, **When** the list renders, **Then** the configured empty state is shown.
2. **Given** a response is being requested, **When** the list renders, **Then** the configured loading state is shown.
3. **Given** an error state is active, **When** the list renders, **Then** the configured error state is shown.

### User Story 4 - Constrain and disable (Priority: P3)

The host disables the component, sets it read-only, or limits capabilities; the component reflects each state.

**Why this priority**: Hosts embed the component in flows where sending must be blocked or limited.

**Independent Test**: Set disabled, read-only, and capability-limited states in turn; confirm the composer and actions respond.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the component is disabled, **When** the user attempts to interact, **Then** input and actions are blocked.
2. **Given** the component is read-only, **When** the list renders, **Then** content is readable and the composer is not editable.
3. **Given** a capability is disabled by the host, **When** the related action would render, **Then** it is hidden or inert.

### Edge Cases

- An unknown or partial token override must fall back to the default rather than break.
- A custom renderer that throws must fall back to the default renderer for that message; other messages must continue to render and function.
- A theme switch while streaming must not lose the stream or the scroll position.
- The host removing all message actions must leave no action affordance.
- A custom Send control in use must keep the Stop affordance reachable during a submission.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The component MUST provide light and dark themes.
- **FR-002**: The component MUST accept a custom theme.
- **FR-003**: Styling MUST use semantic tokens and support class overrides.
- **FR-004**: The host MUST be able to replace the complete message renderer.
- **FR-005**: The host MUST be able to replace individual content renderers.
- **FR-006**: The host MUST be able to replace the Markdown renderer and individual Markdown element renderers.
- **FR-007**: The host MUST be able to replace the Send, Stop, and scroll-to-latest controls.
- **FR-008**: The host MUST be able to replace the empty, loading, typing, and error states.
- **FR-009**: The host MUST be able to add message actions and configure action availability and grouping.
- **FR-010**: The host MUST be able to supply application icons.
- **FR-011**: A custom renderer that throws MUST fall back to the default renderer for that message; other messages MUST continue to render and function.
- **FR-012**: The component MUST provide usable mobile and desktop layouts.
- **FR-013**: The host MUST be able to add composer controls.
- **FR-014**: The component MUST support disabled, read-only, and capability-controlled states.
- **FR-015**: The component MUST ship as a versioned package consumable by host applications on both platforms, and automated tests MUST exercise the packaged artifact, not only source imports.
- **FR-016**: The component MUST run unmodified as a single implementation on both the mobile and desktop hosts. Host differences MUST enter only through the component's documented inputs (configuration, themes, controls, renderers), never through forks or host-specific branches of the component.

### Key Entities

- **Theme**: A set of semantic tokens controlling appearance.
- **Renderer**: Maps messages or content types to their display.
- **Control**: A replaceable interactive piece such as Send or Stop.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: With no customization, every themed surface (message list, composer, Send, Stop, and scroll-to-latest controls, and the empty, loading, typing, and error states) reflects the active theme, and no surface hardcodes a color.
- **SC-002**: A custom theme and custom renderers are used without modifying the component.
- **SC-003**: The component remains fully usable with no customization.
- **SC-004**: A failing custom renderer falls back to the default without breaking the list.
- **SC-005**: Disabled, read-only, and capability-limited states are each reflected in the composer and actions.
- **SC-006**: Every behavior specified in specs 001 through 006 passes on both hosts from the same component code, with no host-specific forks.

## Assumptions

- The component ships with usable defaults; customization is optional.
- The host application owns the design system and wants to control appearance.
- Single-user personalization is the target; multi-brand theming is out of scope.
- Packaging details (module format, type declarations, changelog, peer-dependency configuration) are plan decisions; the spec requires only that the deliverable is a versioned package tested as the packaged artifact.
