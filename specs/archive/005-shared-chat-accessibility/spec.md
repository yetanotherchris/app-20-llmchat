# Feature Specification: Shared Chat Component - Accessibility

**Feature Branch**: `005-shared-chat-accessibility`

**Created**: 2026-09-07

**Status**: Archived

**Input**: User description: "Accessibility for the shared chat component, usable from the start: keyboard-only operation, visible focus, accessible names, minimum touch targets, dynamic type and browser zoom, reduced motion, high contrast, and status that does not rely on color. Screen-reader announcements are out of scope for beta."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Use the chat with a keyboard only (Priority: P1)

The user navigates the composer, send, stop, message actions, and scroll-to-latest using only the keyboard, with visible focus at every step.

**Why this priority**: Keyboard support is the baseline for accessible operation and is required for desktop use.

**Independent Test**: Drive the entire chat flow with the keyboard alone.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chat screen is open, **When** the user tabs through controls, **Then** focus order is logical and each control receives visible focus.
2. **Given** a control has focus, **When** the user activates it with the keyboard, **Then** the action fires.
3. **Given** focus reaches the message list, **When** the user operates it with standard scroll keys, **Then** messages can be scrolled, read, and interacted with.

### User Story 2 - Read with increased text and zoom (Priority: P1)

The user increases text size or zooms to 200%; the layout adapts without clipping or overlap.

**Why this priority**: Larger text is a common need; broken layout at large sizes makes the app unusable.

**Independent Test**: Set the largest supported OS text size and 200% browser zoom; confirm the layout adapts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the largest supported text size, **When** the chat renders, **Then** no content is clipped or overlapped.
2. **Given** browser zoom is at 200%, **When** the chat renders, **Then** the layout remains usable.

### User Story 3 - Perceive status without color (Priority: P2)

Message and chat statuses are conveyed by more than color alone.

**Why this priority**: Color-only status is unreadable with color-blindness or high-contrast settings.

**Independent Test**: Identify streaming, stopped, and error states with color removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a message is streaming, **When** color is removed, **Then** the streaming state is still identifiable.
2. **Given** an error state, **When** color is removed, **Then** the error is still identifiable.

### User Story 4 - Use reduced-motion and high-contrast settings (Priority: P2)

The user enables reduced motion or high contrast; the component honors both.

**Why this priority**: Both settings are system-level and cheap to honor; ignoring them is a real defect.

**Independent Test**: Enable reduced motion and high contrast, then exercise the chat; confirm no component-triggered animation plays and all text and controls remain readable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** reduced motion is enabled, **When** content updates, **Then** no unnecessary animation plays.
2. **Given** high contrast is enabled, **When** the chat renders, **Then** text and UI components meet the applicable contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1 normal text; 3:1 large text and UI components).

### Edge Cases

- Touch targets must meet minimum sizes on both platforms.
- Status must be perceivable without sound or animation.
- Focus indicators must remain visible against both light and dark themes.
- Focus must not be lost when a message is removed: focus moves to a nearby message or control.
- High contrast combined with the dark theme must not produce unreadable surfaces.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The web output MUST meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
- **FR-002**: All controls MUST have accessible names matching their visible labels.
- **FR-003**: The component MUST be fully operable with a keyboard, with visible focus indicators.
- **FR-004**: Touch targets MUST be at least 44 points on iOS and at least 24 CSS pixels on web.
- **FR-005**: The component MUST support dynamic type and 200% browser zoom without clipping.
- **FR-006**: The component MUST honor reduced-motion settings.
- **FR-007**: The component MUST honor high-contrast settings.
- **FR-008**: Status information MUST NOT rely on color alone.
- **FR-009**: FR-001 through FR-008 bind the component's default controls, states, and renderers. Host-supplied replacements (spec 004) are the host's responsibility.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The project's automated WCAG 2.2 AA suite passes, plus the manual checks automation cannot catch: focus order, target size, and reflow at 200% zoom. The suite runs axe-core scoped to the chat; it excludes the `scrollable-region-focusable` rule because the list's scroll container is deliberately not a tab stop (message rows are the keyboard anchors and the standard scroll keys operate the list from a focused row, US1-A3).
- **SC-002**: The full chat flow works with a keyboard only.
- **SC-003**: At 200% browser zoom and the largest supported OS text size, no content is clipped, overlapped, or lost.
- **SC-004**: Status remains identifiable without color.

## Assumptions

- The component is for a single user on a personal device.
- Screen-reader announcements are out of scope for beta; text-to-speech read-aloud may be added later if needed.
- The web output is the primary accessibility target; native iOS gets platform-level checks.
